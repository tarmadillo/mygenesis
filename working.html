        <h2>Websites, <span style="color: #f69736;">Simplified</span></h2>
    </div>
    <p>Building and maintaing a website can be a daunting task. Even in the age of website builders where coding isn’t absolutly necessary, <strong>a good website still takes time to build.</strong> Every minute you spend learning to create your website is a minute away from your core business. I take care of the hassle, leaving you more time to do what you love.</p>
    <p>Never fear the over-sell. <strong>My partnerships are based on trust and honesty.</strong> My goal is to understand the needs of your business, not just your website. I work with you to isolate your vision and discover what truely matters. Together we turn this into a message that actually reaches your users.</p>
    <p>I not only create user-focused websites, but also demystify them. By <strong>providing training with every website I build</strong>, clients are empowered to take greater control of their online presence. I spend the time neccesary to explain the basics of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and steps to take beyond creating a website to ensure a return on investment.</p>

            <p>My name is Tony Armadillo. I am a freelance web designer born and raised in Corpus Christi. Building websites became a hobby for me back in 2008 while finishing my degree in Business Administration. </p>
            <p>In 2010, after a short hiatus, I decided to go back to college, this time for electrical engineering. I graduated in 2014 with a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from Texas A&amp;M University Kingsville.</p>
            <p>After graduation I was drawn back to web design this time with a renewed focus. I realized, while I greatly enjoy digital signal processing, VLSI and transistor design, I still love helping small and local businesses by improving their online presence. It’s likely because creating websites is a nice mix of business, programming and art.</p>
            <p>As for hobbies, it’s difficult for me to define. I guess you could say my biggest hobby is reading or learning. I am currently teaching myself Ruby on Rails for building websites as a service. At the same time, I am also doing research on adaptive image compression to stay current on my electrical engineering.</p>

				<p>Jekyll is GitHub's simple, blog-aware, static site generator.

				<p>The primary benefit is that there are no software or security updates for you to worry about. Therefore, monthly maintenance costs are practically non-existent. Since there is no database involved, static sites load far faster on average. The downside is that it will require a web developer such as myself to push any update to the website.</p>
